In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can arise from the misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods (or their modern counterparts, `strong` and `weak` properties) within the context of KVO (Key-Value Observing).  Specifically, if an observer is not properly removed when it's no longer needed, it might retain the observed object, preventing it from being deallocated even after it's no longer in use. This can cause a memory leak.  Further complication arises if the observer itself is deallocated before the observed object; this can lead to a crash. 

Example demonstrating improper removal of an observer:

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *someString;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... observation logic ...
}

- (void)someMethod {
    [self addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"someString" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];
    // ... some code ...
    // Forgot to remove the observer!
}
@end
```
