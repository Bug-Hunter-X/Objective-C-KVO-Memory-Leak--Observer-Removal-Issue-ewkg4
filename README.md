This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO).  Improper removal of KVO observers can lead to memory leaks and crashes. The `bug.m` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected version. This example highlights the importance of diligent observer management in Objective-C applications to avoid unexpected behavior and maintain application stability.  Understanding how to correctly remove KVO observers is crucial for preventing resource leaks and maintaining a well-behaved application.
